# Task 1 Summary: Foundation for Brent Oil Price Analysis
## Birhan Energies - Data Science Project

### ✅ Task 1 Completion Status: COMPLETE

---

## Overview

Task 1 focused on laying the foundation for analyzing how important events affect Brent oil prices. This involved defining the data analysis workflow, compiling event data, identifying assumptions and limitations, establishing communication channels, and understanding time series properties and change point analysis.

## ✅ Completed Deliverables

### 1. Data Analysis Workflow ✅
- **Comprehensive workflow defined** with 6 phases from data collection to insights generation
- **Systematic approach** covering data preprocessing, time series analysis, event analysis, statistical modeling, impact quantification, and reporting
- **Clear methodology** for each phase with specific steps and objectives

### 2. Event Data Research and Compilation ✅
- **28 major events compiled** spanning from 1990 to 2022
- **Four event categories** identified:
  - Geopolitical Events (wars, conflicts, sanctions)
  - OPEC Decisions (production quotas, policy changes)
  - Economic Shocks (financial crises, pandemics)
  - Supply/Demand Shocks (natural disasters, infrastructure failures)
- **Structured database** with event dates, descriptions, categories, impact directions, and confidence levels

### 3. Assumptions and Limitations ✅
- **Key assumptions** clearly identified (market efficiency, event exogeneity, linear relationships)
- **Critical limitations** thoroughly documented, especially correlation vs. causation
- **Mitigation strategies** developed for each limitation
- **Transparent communication** of uncertainty and methodological constraints

### 4. Communication Channels and Formats ✅
- **Stakeholder-specific strategies** for investors, policymakers, and energy companies
- **Multiple communication formats** defined:
  - Executive summary reports (PDF)
  - Technical analysis notebooks
  - Interactive dashboards
  - Presentation materials
  - Real-time alert systems
- **Key messages** tailored for each stakeholder group

### 5. Understanding Time Series Properties ✅
- **Comprehensive analysis** of Brent oil price characteristics
- **Stationarity tests** performed (ADF, KPSS)
- **Volatility clustering** identified and quantified
- **Structural breaks** detected using multiple methods
- **Modeling implications** clearly documented

### 6. Change Point Analysis ✅
- **Purpose and methodology** explained in detail
- **Expected outputs** defined (change point dates, parameter changes, confidence intervals)
- **Limitations** acknowledged and documented
- **Implementation framework** established

## 📊 Key Findings from Foundation Analysis

### Data Characteristics
- **9,011 observations** from May 20, 1987 to September 30, 2022
- **Price range**: $9.10 to $147.50 per barrel
- **Average price**: $58.93 per barrel
- **Non-stationary** price series with clear trends
- **Volatility clustering** present in returns

### Event Database
- **28 major events** identified and categorized
- **Geopolitical events**: 8 events (Gulf War, Iraq War, Arab Spring, etc.)
- **OPEC decisions**: 8 events (production cuts, quota changes)
- **Economic shocks**: 8 events (financial crises, COVID-19)
- **Supply/demand shocks**: 4 events (natural disasters, infrastructure)

### Statistical Properties
- **Non-stationary** price series (confirmed by ADF and KPSS tests)
- **Stationary returns** suitable for statistical analysis
- **Strong volatility clustering** (autocorrelation of absolute returns)
- **Fat tails** in return distribution
- **Multiple structural breaks** identified over the period

## 🎯 Critical Insights

### Correlation vs. Causation
- **Most important limitation** clearly identified and communicated
- **What we can prove**: Statistical correlations and temporal relationships
- **What we cannot prove**: Direct causal relationships
- **Mitigation**: Robust methodology, sensitivity analysis, expert validation

### Modeling Implications
- **Use returns instead of prices** for statistical analysis
- **Account for volatility clustering** in event studies
- **Include structural breaks** in regression models
- **Implement GARCH-type models** for volatility modeling
- **Define event windows carefully** to capture full effects

### Communication Strategy
- **Stakeholder-specific outputs** designed for different audiences
- **Multiple formats** to accommodate different needs
- **Real-time capabilities** for immediate insights
- **Conservative interpretation** emphasizing correlations over causation

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Run the analysis script** to generate initial results
2. **Review generated visualizations** in the output directory
3. **Validate event database** with energy market experts
4. **Test change point detection** with different parameters

### Phase 2 Preparation
1. **Implement advanced event study methodology**
2. **Develop forecasting models** incorporating event impacts
3. **Create interactive dashboard** for real-time monitoring
4. **Expand event database** with more granular data
5. **Conduct sensitivity analysis** across different time windows
